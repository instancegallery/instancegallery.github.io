# Host a Node

Instance Gallery runs across several autonomously managed host nodes in New York City. The Gallery enthusiastically welcomes requests to host a Gallery &ldquo;node.&rdquo; Hosts do not have to be located in New York City; they may be anywhere in the world. Hosting is simple and requires very little from host spaces.
