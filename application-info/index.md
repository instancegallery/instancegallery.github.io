# Apply for the Instance Residency Program

Thank you for your interest in the Instance Residency program! Before you proceed to the application form, please take a moment to review the following information. Please be aware that by applying to the Instance Residency, you acknowledge that you understand and agree by the terms set forth below. 

## Program Overview

Instance Residency is a free, quasidigital residency program focused on providing generative creative space for artists working in photographic media. Each residency cycle lasts for three (3) months, during which residents will focus on creating and posting new photographic works. Works will be semi-public, in that they will be viewable by members of the public who visit physical locations where Instance nodes are hosted. Residents may consider this as a type of partially digital open studio type program.

* Instance Residency is a free program; there are no fees to apply or to participate.
* Works are submitted during the course of three (3) months, and posted to their digital studio-exhibition spaces.
* Works will be semi-public; they will *not* be published to the public Internet, but published to private pages accessible only at public physical spaces throughout New York City.
* The Residency will terminate in some kind of group event, whether it is a gallery show at a partnered art space in New York, an artist talk, or other event determined by the residents' vote.
* Members of the public may interact with artists via a free, end-to-end encrypted chatroom that serves as the open door to their studio-exhibition spaces. This chatroom may be turned on and off at the will of the residents. Any members of the public found to be abusing this service will be banned permanently; any residents found abusing this service will be banned from the program.

## Resident Code of Conduct

In general, the CoC requires that all artists engaged in the Instance Residency program treat their fellow residents and any members of the public who may engage with them with as much respect as they are shown. Instance Gallery has a very strict anti-racism, anti-oppression, and anti-bigotry policy. Behavior that is determined to attack residents or members of the public on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexuality, or financial standing will be immediately expelled from the program and will not be welcomed back.

## Resident Code of Operations

Instance Residency aims to create a unique experience wherein artists can focus on developing their practice. In part this is achieved by removing the external pressures that come from the public Internet. This tends to allow artists to experiment more freely, and gives the Residency intention. Therefore, our Code of Operations mandates that all residents, during the course of their time in residency, do not post works created for the residency to the Internet, including to any social media profiles or their own websites. This means that newly created works must not be shared on the public Internet during the residency period. However, works may be submitted for publication in print publications or in digital publications so long as they will not be published during the residency period. Instance Gallery does not intend to assume any copyright on works produced or shared during the residency â€” once the residency is ended, residents should feel free (and hopefully excited) to share their new work wherever they wish. By answering "Yes" to the following, you agree to abide by this Code of Operations if accepted as a resident. 

In short, we expect all residents to follow these main guidelines, and reserve the right to remove any resident in violation of any of these points:

* Residents may *not* post works to the residency space as well as to public online channels, including social media and the artists' websites, until after the end of the residency.
* Instance Gallery will never request any kind of copyright control over the works produced and shared within the residency.
* Residents extend temporary permission to Instance Gallery to post the works to the node servers. Any work may be removed at any time per the residents' request. The digital space is for residents' use and creative expansion first and foremost.
* Any projects during the course of the residency will seek explicit permission for the reproduction of any images created on the part of the artist. **Instance Gallery respects the rights of artists to their work.** We will never publish anything without your permission.

## Termination Agreement

The Termination Agreement for Instance Residency is simply this: should any resident be found in violation of the Code of Conduct or the Code of Operations, they will have their digital studio key permanently revoked, and they will not be permitted to engage in any future Residency cycles or to use any Instance services. Instance Gallery does not maintain responsibility to explain beyond a default termination notification, nor attempt to reform a resident's behavior. In the event that a resident must be removed, that resident will be replaced with another applicant on the waiting list. By applying to the Residency, you agree to these conditions.

## Application Process

To apply for the Instance Residency, you will need to submit a completed application form, which includes submitting five (5) works for review via this form.

**Please ensure you have reviewed all of the above information. By submitting an application form, you agree to all of the terms described above.**
