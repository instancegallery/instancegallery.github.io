### ABOUT
	
#### The Gallery

Instance Gallery is a [quasidigital->FAQ] art space that supports artists working across the spectrum of photographic media. Proliferation of photographic works most notably occurs via the [[Instance Residency]] program.

The work of our residents is not exhibited on the public Internet. Rather, works are exhibited on an intranet of autonomously networked servers provisioned at various physical locations throughout New York City. These locations which must be visited in person in order to see residents' work.

To find out how to visit a gallery instance, see the [Visit] page.


#### Instance Residency

The Instance Residency is a free residency program that takes place partly in digital spaces and partly in physical spaces throughout New York City.

Residents may participate from any part of the world, but all in-person locations and events take place in New York.

On the first day of the residency period, accepted artists will receive a "digital key," valid throughout the duration of their residency period. This key will allow them to connect to their own digital exhibition-studio space. This space consists of unlimited static pages on which works submitted to the studio manager will be posted. These exhibition-studios will be viewable from any and all spaces in which Instance servers are located (see the [Visit] page).

Residents may post whatever works they wish on their pages, so long as they are current. The pages may be thought of as a digital "white box" for residents to showcase their works in progress.

Residents will be able to share current work throughout the duration of the residency, which spans one and a half months. Residents will have access to a resident-only chatroom, as well as other amenities and resources.

The end of each residency will culminate in some type of in-person event in New York City. This can be anything from a physical gallery exhibition, to an artist discussion or other event. The closing event is determined by resident vote and feasibility.

### FAQ

**Q**: How does Instance Gallery work?

**A**: This is a very unconventional structure, so let us walk you through it.

The Internet as we know it (the thing you're using to read this right now) is actually just a bunch of computers that are all connected in a giant network - or series of networks - that span the globe. We call this the "public Internet."

"Intranet" is a term used to refer to an internal network, in which only computers connected to the network may access one another.

In other words, one computer at one location and another computer at another location and a third computer at a third location, who are all covertly networked together but cannot be reached by the public Internet, may be considered part of an intranet. There is not much technically different between the public Internet and any given intranet - both use the same technologies to function. The real differences lie in how they are accessed and for what they are used; which is to say that the distinction is more functional than it is technical.

Instance Gallery is a gallery that exists _solely_ on an intranet, which is made up of several computers that are connected together at various venues throughout New York City. However, remember that because the intranet is _not_ part of the public Internet, it _cannot be accessed via the Internet_. This means you cannot simply go to `https://www.somewhere.com`, as you normally might for a website on the public Internet, in order to access the digital residency space. Instead, it is _required_ that you physically visit one of the locations that act as host venues for "nodes," which is what we call each computer connected _inside_ the intranet.

**Q:** Why this rather than something on the public Internet?

**A:** Firstly, Instance Gallery takes advantage of already existent autonomous digital infrastructure as it continues to grow within NYC. In part, Instance Gallery is part of a much larger project with which it shares a vision, though its goals as an artist space are its own.

Secondly, the Internet offers exposure on a global scale, but this is not generally the goal of most residency programs; it is not the goal of Instance Residency, either. It is the mission of Instance to support artists working within photographic media by creating space for those artists to work in the vicinity of one another via semi-private space. At the same time, cultivating a serious external audience to the work produced by the residents.


**Q:** Are there any fees or costs associated with the Residency program?

**A:** No. At this time, there are absolutely no fees or costs required to participate in the Instance Residency program.
