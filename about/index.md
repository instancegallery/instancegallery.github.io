Instance Gallery is a [quasidigital]({{ "/faq/" | relative_url }}) art space that supports artists working across the spectrum of photographic media. Proliferation of photographic works most notably occurs via the [Instance Residency]({{ "/residency/" | relative_url }}) program.

The work of our residents is not exhibited on the public Internet. Rather, works are exhibited on an intranet of autonomously networked servers provisioned at various physical locations throughout New York City. These locations must be visited in person in order to see residents' work.

To find out how to visit a gallery instance, see the [Visit]({{ "/visit/" | relative_url }}) page.
