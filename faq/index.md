### What is Instance Gallery?

Instance Gallery is a quasidigital art space focusing on photographic work. 

The Internet as we know it (the thing you're using to read this right now) is actually just a bunch of computers that are all connected in a giant network—or series of networks—that span the globe. We call this the "public Internet."

*Intranet* is a term used to refer to an internal network, in which only computers connected to the same network may access one another. A related term is *extranet*, in which only specific computers, rather than any computer, can connect to the others.

In other words, one computer at one location and another computer at another location and a third computer at a third location, who are all (possibly covertly) networked together but cannot be reached by the public Internet, may be considered part of an intranet or extranet. There is not much technically different between the public Internet and any given intranet or extranet. Both use the same technologies to function. The real differences lie in how they are accessed and for what they are used; which is to say that the distinction is more functional than it is technical.

Instance Gallery is a gallery that exists *solely* on an extranet, which is made up of several computers that are connected together at various venues throughout New York City. However, remember that because the extranet is *not* directly accessible from the public Internet, it *cannot be accessed via the Internet*. This means you cannot simply go to "somewhere.com" as you normally might for a website on the public Internet in order to access the digital residency space. Instead, you must physically visit one of the locations that act as host venues for &ldquo;nodes,&rdquo; which is what we call each computer connected inside the gallery network.

## Why this rather than something on the public Internet?

Firstly, Instance Gallery takes advantage of already existent autonomous digital infrastructure as it continues to grow within NYC. In part, Instance Gallery is part of a much larger project with which it shares a vision, though its goals as an artist space are its own.

Secondly, the Internet offers exposure on a global scale, but this is not generally the goal of most residency programs; it is not the goal of Instance Residency, either. It is the mission of Instance to support artists working within photographic media by creating space for those artists to work in the vicinity of one another via semi-private space. At the same time, cultivating a serious external audience to the work produced by the residents.
