Instance Gallery is a [quasidigital]({{ "/faq/#how-does-instance-gallery-work" | relative_url }}) art space supporting photographers and artists working with photographic media. Proliferation of photographic works most notably occurs via the [Instance Residency]({{ "/residency/" | relative_url }}) program.

The work of our residents is *not* exhibited on the public Internet. Rather, works are exhibited digitially on an intranet of autonomously networked servers provisioned at various physical locations throughout New York City.

These locations must be visited in person in order to view residents' work. To find out how to visit a gallery instance, see the [Visit]({{ "/visit/" | relative_url }}) page.
