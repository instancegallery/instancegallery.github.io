title: Instance Residency Program
---

The Instance Residency is a free residency program that takes place partly in digital spaces and partly in physical spaces throughout New York City.

Residents may participate from any part of the world, but all in-person locations and events take place in New York.

On the first day of the residency period, accepted artists will receive a &ldquo;digital key,&rdquo; valid throughout the duration of their residency period. This key will allow them to connect to their own digital exhibition-studio space. This space consists of unlimited static pages on which works submitted to the studio manager will be posted. These exhibition-studios will be viewable from any and all spaces in which Instance servers are located (see the [Visit]({{ "/visit/" | relative_url }}) page).

Residents may post whatever works they wish on their pages, so long as they are current. The pages may be thought of as a digital "white box" for residents to showcase their works in progress.

Residents will be able to share current work throughout the duration of the residency, which spans three months. Residents will have access to a resident-only chatroom, as well as other amenities and resources.

The end of each residency will culminate in some type of in-person event in New York City. This can be anything from a physical gallery exhibition, to an artist discussion or other event. The closing event is determined by resident vote and feasibility.
