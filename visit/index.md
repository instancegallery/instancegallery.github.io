# Visit Instance Gallery

Instance Gallery is hosted across a series of autonomously managed servers across New York City. In order to visit the Gallery and see the public exhibitions of our residents, visitors must visit one of our host spaces.

Want to help expand Instance Gallery? You can [host a node]({{ "/host/" | relative_url }}) in your space!
