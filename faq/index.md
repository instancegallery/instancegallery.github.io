## What is Instance Gallery?

Instance Gallery is a quasidigital art space focusing on photographic work. "Quasidigital" here means that works are primarily hosted digitally within an autonomous intranet—*not* the public Internet, however, the experience for members of the public to visit the space is a physical act, and the final event at the end of residency cycles take place in physical locations.

## How does Instance Gallery work?

The Internet as we know it (the thing you're using to read this right now) is actually just a bunch of computers that are all connected in a giant network—or series of networks—that span the globe. We call this the "public Internet."

*Intranet* is a term used to refer to an internal network, in which only computers connected to the same network may access one another. A related term is *extranet*, in which only specific computers, rather than any computer, can connect to the others.

In other words, one computer at one location and another computer at another location and a third computer at a third location, who are all (possibly covertly) networked together but cannot be reached by the public Internet, may be considered part of an intranet or extranet. There is not much technically different between the public Internet and any given intranet or extranet. Both use the same technologies to function. The real differences lie in how they are accessed and for what they are used; which is to say that the distinction is more functional than it is technical.

Instance Gallery is a gallery that exists *solely* on an extranet, which is made up of several computers that are connected together at various venues throughout New York City. However, remember that because the extranet is *not* directly accessible from the public Internet, it *cannot be accessed via the Internet*. This means you cannot simply go to "somewhere.com" as you normally might for a website on the public Internet in order to access the digital residency space. Instead, you must physically visit one of the locations that act as host venues for &ldquo;nodes,&rdquo; which is what we call each computer connected inside the gallery network.

Want to host a node? You can do this from anywhere on Earth. See our [Host page]({{ "/host/" | relative_url }}) for more information.

## What is the Instance Residency?

Instance Residency is a free quasidigital photographic artist residency open to any artist working in a photographic medium anywhere in the world. This Residency is what mainly populates the Gallery. Residency cycles last three months, during which time, five to eight photographers are invited to the semi-private digital space to share their works-in-progress and to share ideas. At the end of each cycle, the residency culminates in some type of final event, either a gallery exhibition, artist talk, or similar. See more on the [Residency page]({{ "/residency/" | relative_url }}).

## How does the Instance Residency work?

While the "nodes" that make up the autonomous intranet on which Instance Gallery is hosted are only publicly accessible by being attached to local WiFi, resident artists have the special ability to connect via the dark web to nodes from wherever they want. Using these personalized dark web addresses, each resident may view each others' work and participate in conversations on the "lounge" chat room. Submitting work is as simple as submitting work via e-mail to the gallery manager. The Instance Residency is available to any artist working in a primarily photographic medium from anywhere on the planet, although in-person events such as exhibitions and artist talks at this time will be held in New York City.

## Why this rather than something on the public Internet?

Firstly, Instance Gallery takes advantage of already existent autonomous digital infrastructure as it continues to grow within NYC. In part, Instance Gallery is part of a much larger project with which it shares a vision, though its goals as an artist space are its own.

Secondly, the Internet offers exposure on a global scale, but this is not generally the goal of most residency programs; it is not the goal of Instance Residency, either. It is the mission of Instance to support artists working within photographic media by creating space for those artists to work in the vicinity of one another via semi-private space. At the same time, cultivating a serious external audience to the work produced by the residents.


## Are there any fees or costs associated with the Residency program?

No. At this time, there are absolutely no fees or costs required to participate in the Instance Residency program.

## How do I apply for the Residency?

See our [Residency page]({{ "/residency/" | relative_url }}).

## How can I find out about Instance events? 

Check out our [Events]({{ "/events/" | relative_url }}) page! We do not have a newsletter or calendar feed at this time, as special events are fairly infrequent (hence special!). Instance Gallery does not utilize social media. Our ethos is to create new, autonomously managed channels for expression.
